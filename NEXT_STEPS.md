# Next Steps for Content Factory AI Project

## Current Status
- ✅ Core application structure is in place
- ✅ Database configuration updated with Supabase connection
- ✅ All tests are passing
- ✅ Application is running successfully

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup
1. Replace `your_supabase_key_here` in [.env](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/.env) with your actual Supabase key
2. Run the setup script to create database tables:
   ```bash
   python setup_db.py
   ```
3. Verify tables were created in your Supabase database

### 2. Environment Configuration
Update [.env](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/.env) with real credentials for:
- Redis connection (if not using localhost)
- Social media API keys
- AI Avatar service credentials

### 3. Business Logic Implementation
Key areas to implement:
- Product discovery service in [app/services/product_discovery.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/app/services/product_discovery.py)
- Video generation service in [app/services/video_generation.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/app/services/video_generation.py)
- Social media publishing in [app/services/social_media_publisher.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/app/services/social_media_publisher.py)
- AI avatar integration in [app/services/ai_avatar.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/app/services/ai_avatar.py)

### 4. Background Tasks Setup
1. Install Redis server if not already installed
2. Start Celery worker:
   ```bash
   celery -A celery_worker.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
   ```
3. Start Celery Beat for scheduled tasks:
   ```bash
   celery -A celery_worker.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
   ```

### 5. Testing
Add comprehensive tests for all services in the [tests/](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/tests/) directory

## Deployment Checklist

### Docker Deployment
1. Verify [docker-compose.yml](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/docker-compose.yml) configuration
2. Build and run containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Production Deployment
1. Update security settings in [.env](file:///c%3A/Users/Mimi/content-factory-ai/.env)
2. Configure proper SSL certificates
3. Set up monitoring and logging
4. Configure backup strategies

## API Endpoints

Once deployed, the following endpoints will be available:
- Products API: `/api/v1/products/`
- Videos API: `/api/v1/videos/`
- Social Media API: `/api/v1/social-media/`
- Health Check: `/health`
- API Documentation: `/docs`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all environment variables are properly set
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Ensure all required services are running (Redis, FFmpeg)
4. Check application logs for error messages
